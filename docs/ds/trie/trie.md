# Trie

## Overview

A Trie is an efficient information retrieval data structure. Searches with Trie has the key length complexity. The time needed to a well balanced Binary Search Tree is proportional to M \* log(N), where M is maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Trie is faster than BST, your complexity is **O(M)**. The Achilles' heel of Trie data structure is the required storage size.

Here we have a graphical representation of a Trie:

The above trie stores the words **a**, **am**, **all**, **to**, **the**, **they**, **there**, **their**, **no**, and **not**.

## Implementation
