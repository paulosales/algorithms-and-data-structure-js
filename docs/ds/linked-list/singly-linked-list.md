## Singly Single List x Array

There are advantages and drawbacks that must be considered when you are deciding to use Linked Lists instead of Arrays. Let's check it out:

### Advantages

- Linked Lists has dynamic size and arrays have fixed sizes. It means that an array allocates all memory before using it to store data. Otherwise, Linked List memory usage grows as the data is stored.

- It is easy to insert and delete data into a Linked List, whereas the same is not true in an array.

### Drawbacks

- It's not possible to access a Linked List data randomly.
